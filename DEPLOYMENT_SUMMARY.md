## What's Ready for Deployment

Your PiggyWise application is now ready to be deployed to Vercel. The following components have been prepared:

1. **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL database is configured and schema is deployed
2. **Environment Variables**: Production environment configured with all necessary secrets and connections
3. **Build Configuration**: Project is set up to generate Prisma client during build
4. **Deployment Instructions**: Step-by-step guide created in `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md`

## Next Steps

Follow the instructions in `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` to:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure the environment variables
3. Deploy the application
4. Verify functionality

## Local Development 

You can continue developing locally using your existing PostgreSQL setup. When you're ready to deploy changes:

1. Push your changes to GitHub
2. Vercel will automatically redeploy your application
3. For schema changes, remember to update the Neon database using:
   ```bash
   cp .env.production .env
   npx prisma db push
   mv .env.local.backup .env
   ```

## Important Reminders

- Keep your `.env.production` file secure and never commit it to version control
- When making schema changes, always apply them to both local and production databases
- For production issues, check Vercel logs and Neon database metrics
